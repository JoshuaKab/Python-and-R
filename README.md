<h1>Introduction:</h1>

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis Google case study!
This case study represents course 8 “Capstone project” of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera


**About the company:**

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network
of 692 stations across Chicago. Cyclistic has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day 
passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The Scenario:

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximising the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the data analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes
differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.


Moreno, the director of marketing, has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

There are three questions that will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: 

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

****The business task:****
Analyse the Cyclistic data set for the pass 12 months to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

**Stakeholders:**

***Lily Moreno:*** The director of marketing. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.

Deliverables:

1. A description of all data sources used

1. A summary of the analysis
1. Supporting visualisations and key findings
1. Top three to four recommendations based on the analysis
Timeline:

A week Periode 

***1- A description of all data sources used:***
The data-set which will be used for the analysis has been provided by Cyclistic management. It consists of 12 CSV files, one file for each month, from march 2022 to Feb 2023.
*This is public data that has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this licence

***2- Cleaning and manipulating the data:***
Cleaning and ensuring data quality is a vital part of the data analytics process. If the data has inconsistencies and/or errors it will lead probably to bad insights.
In a field like marketing, bad insights can mean wasting money on poorly targeted campaigns.
There are nine columns in each file containing data about all rides that took place in the year 2020:

1. ride_id
2. rideable_type: the type of the bike (docked_bike, electric_bike and classic_bike)
3. started_at: the date and time the ride started at
4. ended_at: the date and time the ride ended at
5. start_station_name: station’s name the ride started at
6. start_station_id: station’s ID the ride started at
7. end_station_name: station’s name the ride ended at
8. end_station_id: station’s ID the ride ended at
9. member_casual: casual rider or member rider
